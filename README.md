# arise-incremental

A solo leveling version of kittens game built with React, TypeScript, Zustand, and TanStack Query.

## Features

- **Zustand Store with Local Persistence**: Game state is automatically saved to localStorage and restored on page reload
- **TanStack Query (ts-query)**: Public queries for accessing game state with automatic refetching
- **Incremental Game Mechanics**: 
  - Gather resources manually by clicking buttons
  - Build structures that automatically generate resources
  - Buildings have escalating costs (1.15x multiplier per purchase)
  - Real-time resource production rates displayed

## Resources

- 🌾 **Catnip**: Basic resource for early buildings
- 🪵 **Wood**: Used for more advanced structures
- ⛰️ **Minerals**: Required for late-game buildings
- 🔬 **Science**: Generated by libraries for upgrades

## Buildings

- **Catnip Field**: Produces catnip automatically
- **Hut**: Basic housing
- **Log House**: Advanced housing
- **Library**: Produces science for research
- **Mine**: Produces minerals

## Tech Stack

- React 19
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Zustand (state management with persistence)
- TanStack Query (React Query for public queries)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Project Structure

- `src/store/gameStore.ts` - Zustand store with game state and persistence
- `src/queries/gameQueries.ts` - TanStack Query hooks for accessing game state
- `src/components/` - React components for UI
  - `ResourceDisplay.tsx` - Shows current resources and production rates
  - `GatheringActions.tsx` - Manual resource gathering buttons
  - `BuildingList.tsx` - Building purchase interface
- `src/App.tsx` - Main app component with game loop

## Game Loop

The game updates every 100ms, calculating resource generation based on owned buildings. State is automatically persisted to localStorage, so progress is never lost!
